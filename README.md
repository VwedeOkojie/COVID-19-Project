## Project Description
This project aims to analyze COVID-19 deaths data to gain insights into the global impact of the pandemic. The analysis includes trends over time, regional comparisons, and other key metrics to undestand the progression of the virus.

## Data Extraction
The project uses COVID-19 deaths data sourced from Our World in Data. The dataset provides daily counts of COVID-19 deaths for various countries.

## Technolgies Used
* SQL (SQLite, MySQL, or other RDBMS)
* Python (for data preprocessing if needed)

## Data Processing
* Cleaning the dataset (handling missing values, removing duplicates)
* Transforming the data into a format suitable for analysis

## Data Loading
* Loading the cleaned data into a SQL database

## Analysis and Insights
* Total number of deaths globally
* Daily death trends
* Regional comparisons
* Mortality rates
* Impact of interventions (lockdowns, mask mandates, etc.)

## How to Use the Project
1. Download the dataset from the provided source.
2. Clean and preprocess the data using Python if necessary.
3. Load the data into a SQL database.
4. Run SQL queries to analyze the data and extract insights.
